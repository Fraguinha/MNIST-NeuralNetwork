How to compile:

    gcc -o neural_network.exe neural_network.c -lm

How to execute:

    There are 3 ways of executing:

        1: ./neural_network.exe

            if you dont provide commandline arguments the program will create a new network, randomize it, train it and save the trained network to a file called smarty_pants.bin

        2: ./neural_network.exe smarty_pants.bin

            if you provide a neural_network binary file as a sole commandline argument, it will run through all the tests, show fails and overall accuracy

        3: ./neural_network.exe smarty_pants.bin 1 2 3 (...)

            all arguments after the neural_network binary file are considered specific images to test on, and show more elaborate output
